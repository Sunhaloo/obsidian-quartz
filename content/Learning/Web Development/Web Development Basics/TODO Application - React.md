# Planning

> [!TIP] The Goal?
> Build a TODO list application with '[[Learning/Web Development/Web Development Data View#React Folder | React]]'.
>
> The application needs to have:
>
> - Login Page
> - Toggle Theme
> - Weather
> - AI Chatbot

> [!INFO] Software and Tools
> - React and Vite with 'JSX'
> 	- Designs from '[Ant Design](https://ant.design/)'
> 	- Follow the same layout as [this](https://github.com/Sunhaloo/Simple-HTML-CSS-JS-TODO)
> - SQLite Database
> - Object Relational Mapping: [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/)

# Setup Project

- Setup a *private* GitHub repository for our project using [github-cli](https://cli.github.com/):

```bash
# create a private repo 'todo' and clone
gh repo create todo --private --add-readme --description "TODO App in React" --clone
```

- Create the 'React' **front-end** *project* / folder:

```bash
# create a folder that acts as our 'client' i.e font-end
npm create vite@latest client -- --template react
```

> `react` instead of `react-ts` is going to allow us to use `.jsx` file!

- Create a folder for the **back-end**:

```bash
# create folder for 'server' i.e back-end
mkdir server
```

- Initialise `npm` / 'Node' project:

```bash
# change directory to our backend
cd server

# initialise the node project
npm init -y
```

- Install the required dependencies:

```bash
# install the required dependencies for our project
npm install express knex sqlite3 cors dotenv
```

- Install `nodemon` a [deamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing))

```bash
# install what is essentially what's 'Vite' is doing
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

> [!INFO] What did we install?
> - `express`: Web framework for API building
> - `knex`: The object relational mapping --> ORM builder
> - `sqlite3`: The actual database ( driver )
> - `cors`: Allows front-end to make requests to back-end ( allowing React to make requests )
> - `dotenv`: Loading of environment variable from file
> - `nodemon`: Auto restarts back-end server when update is made ( development only )

> [!INFO]
> After running these `npm` command, you should see that the `package.json` file gets updated!

- Create the necessary files and folders **in** our `server` folder:

```bash
# create the following folders
mkdir db routers controllers middleware

# create the following files
touch index.js knexfile.js .env .gitignore
```

- Update the `server/.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
node_modules/
.env
*.db
*.sqlite
*.sqlite3
```

> [!INFO] Testing
> - Add the following code in the `server/server.js` file:
>
> ```js
> console.log("Hello Server");
> ```
>
> - Run the following command to check if we have an output:
>
> ```bash
> # run the `server.js` file
> npm run start
> ```
>
> > [!SUCCESS]
> > When you run the `npm` command above, you should see that you have the following output:
> >
> > ```console
> > Hello Server
> > ```
>
> > Very Nice!
>

# Configure The Knex

- Add this code to the `knexfile.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  development: {
    client: "sqlite3",
    connection: {
      filename: "./db/app.db",
    },
    useNullAsDefault: true,
    migrations: {
      directory: "./db/migrations",
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: "./db/seeds",
    },
  },
};
```

> [!NOTE]
> > I hate Django! I don't fucking understand it!
>
> In Django, as you know we have the `python manage.py makemigrations` and **after** running the latter; you are going to *run* the `python manage.py migrate`.
>
> The first command is basically telling Django to:
>
> - Take the *highly abstracted* code that the user has written in his / her `models.py` file
> - Create another file that is going be already populated with how the table should be created
>
> Then after running the *second* `migrate` command; you are going to see that, it then that Django is going to "*connect*" with the `db.sqlite3` file and then actually **write** the 'SQL' data definition commands so that it creates the tables!
>
> This is basically what Knex is doing! The `makemigration` command here is `npx knex migrate:make the_js_file_name`.
>
> > [!WARNING] Butt ))... Big Butt!
> > Compared to Django whereby the `0001_initial.py` is <strong> <span style="color: red;"> not</span> </strong> going to be **populated**.
> >
> > What Knex is going to do; its going to **create** and **empty** `the_js_file_name` and then we are going to have to manually tell `sqlite` how to proceed with the creation of the tables!
> >
> > > Its only then that we are going to be able to run the `npx knex migrate:latest`!
> >
>
> > You are going to see what I am talking about below...
>

- Add the following lines to our `.env` file:

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=api_key_to_be_added_later
```

- Initialise Knex and create the migrations:

```bash
# make the migrations --> basically running `makemigrations` from Django
# our user's table
npx knex migrate:make create_users_table

# our todo's table
npx knex migrate:make create_todos_table

# switch to the `server/db` folder
cd db

# create the following 'seeds' folder
mkdir seeds
```

> [!INFO] What is the `seeds` folder?
> In short, its just **sample** data that we can use and play around when we are developing the application!
>
> > That's basically it!
>

- After running the above `migrate:make` commands using `npx knex`; you should see this output and also have the respective file inside each folder:

```console
Using environment: development
Using environment: development
Using environment: development
Created Migration: /home/username/GitHub/todo/server/db/db/migrations/20251107112030_create_users_table.js
Using environment: development
Using environment: development
Using environment: development
Created Migration: /home/username/GitHub/todo/server/db/db/migrations/20251107112031_create_todos_table.js
```

## Write The Schema For Tables

- Head into the `db/migrations` folder and open the `{current_date_time}_create_users_table.js` and add the following code:

```js
/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
// creation of 'user' table
exports.up = function (knex) {
  // use the `createTable` function to define - create table in database
  return knex.schema.createTable("user", (table) => {
    // our fields
    table.increments("id").primary();
    table.string("username", 50).notNullable().unique();
    table.string("email", 100).notNullable().unique();
    table.string("password").notNullable();
    table.enu("gender", ["male", "female"]).notNullable();

    // add time stamps of when created / updated
    table.timestamps(true, true);
  });
};

/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
// deletion of user table
exports.down = function (knex) {
  // use the `dropTable` to delete the table
  return knex.schema.dropTable("user");
};
```

- Head into the `db/migrations` folder and open the `{current_date_time}_create_todos_table.js` and add the following code:

```js
/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
// creation of 'todos' table
exports.up = function (knex) {
  // use the `createTable` function to define - create table in database
  return knex.schema.createTable("todo", (table) => {
    // our fields
    table.increments("id").primary();
    table.text("description").notNullable();
    table
      .enu("category", [
        "Code Review",
        "Coding",
        "Debugging",
        "Deployment",
        "Documentation",
        "Learning",
        "Meeting",
        "Miscellaneous",
        "Planning",
        "Refactoring",
        "Testing",
      ])
      .defaultTo("Miscellaneous");
    table.boolean("completed").defaultTo(false);

    // add time stamps of when created / updated
    table.timestamps(true, true);

    // create the field for the foreign key here
    table.integer("user_id").unsigned().notNullable();
    // make the actual link using 'references'
    table.foreign("user_id").references("user.id").onDelete("CASCADE");
  });
};

/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
// deletion of user table
exports.down = function (knex) {
  // use the `dropTable` to delete the table
  return knex.schema.dropTable("todo");
};
```

## Run The Migrations

Now, we need to actually make `sqlite` think that we are actually running these 'Data Definition Language' commands like `CREATE`.

- Run the following command to `migrate`:

```bash
# run the migrations
npx knex migrate:latest
```

> [!INFO] Switching Computers
> I am now at my desktop and I just clone the 'todo' repository that we are currently working on!
>
> Therefore running the above command gave me this:
>
> ```console
> Need to install the following packages:
> knex@3.1.0
> Ok to proceed? (y)
> ```
>
> Therefore similar to a Python virtual environment and the `requirements.txt` file. On a different computers that **does** not have the dependencies installed... We are going to have to *manually* install them!
>
> > So compared to Python whereby we **don't** push the *virtual environment*... Here we just push everything!
>
> Therefore to install all the ( *development* ) dependencies **from** the *file*; you can simply use the following `npm` command:
>
> ```bash
> # install all the dependencies on another computer ( for example )
> npm install
> ```

- Output logs after running the above command:

```console
Using environment: development
Batch 1 run: 2 migrations
```

> [!SUCCESS]
> You should now see that we have our `db/app.db` SQLite database file!

# Configure The Main Express.JS Server

## Setup Connection Between Database And Server

- Create a new file `knex.js` **inside** the `server/db` directory:

```js
// import the 'knex' library
const knex = require("knex");
const knexconfig = require("../knexfile.js");

// get the current environment --> default to 'development' if not found
const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV || "development";

// initialise knex with our 'knexfile.js' configuratin file
const db = knex(knexconfig[environment]);

// export the connection ( to be used in other files )
module.exports = db;
```

The above code / `knex.js` file is going to create the **connection** between the *server* and *database*. Therefore, with the last line in the file, i.e, `module.exports = db;` allows us to use *this* connection from **anywhere** in our `server` folder!

## Create / Configure The Main Server File

- Add the following code to the `server/server.js` file:

```js
// add the 'express', 'cors' and 'dotenv' libraries
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

// simply import the data found in our `.env` file
require("dotenv").config();

// create the actual 'express' application / server
const app = express();
// define the port ( default to environment variable or '5000' )
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// define the middleware with 'cors'
// NOTE: the function that is going to allow front-end to talk with back-end
app.use(cors());

// convert front-end data into JS object
app.use(express.json());

// Routings

// test the main "landing" route
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    message: "TODO API Running!",
    status: "success",
  });
});

// start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on 'http://localhost:${PORT}'`);
});
```

- Therefore, if you go ahead and run the `npm run dev` command inside the `todo/server` directory:

```console
> server@1.0.0 dev
> nodemon server

[nodemon] 3.1.10
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,cjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (3) from .env -- tip: 📡 add observability to secrets: https://dotenvx.com/ops
Server running on 'http://localhost:5000'
```

- Open your browser and head over to `http://localhost:5000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, you should see this:

```console
{
  "message": "TODO API Running!",
  "status": "success"
}
```

> [!TIP] Testing Something
> As you can see the above output in the **browser** is due to this piece of code here:
>
> ```js
> // test the main "landing" route
> app.get("/", (req, res) => {
>  res.json({
>    message: "TODO API Running!",
>    status: "success",
>  });
> });
> ```
>
> As you can see its at the "*root*" of the URL as we have `/`... But what if we add something like this below the above code in the `server.js` file?
>
> ```js
> app.get("/someroute", (req, res) => {
>  res.json({
>    message: "Another Routing",
>    status: "success",
>  });
> });
> ```
>
> - Therefore, if you head over to this very URL now; `http://localhost:5000/someroute` you should see this:
>
> ```console
> {
>  "message": "Another Routing",
>  "status": "success"
> }
> ```
>
> > [!NOTE]
> > I have **removed** the above *testing* code that we just wrote... Again it was just for testing purposes!
>

> [!INFO] What is `app.use(express.json());`?
> Let's say that our user needs to enter his **username** and **password** to be able to login to the web-app.
>
> After entering his / her credentials, we need to make a *requests* to the **server** to see if that is present.
>
> Our "*server*" only understands 'JSON' information; but when the user presses the *login* button or whatever. The data that is going to be sent will be in the following format:
>
> ```console
> "{\"username\":\"Joe Mama\",\"password\":\"1234\"}"
> ```
>
> > This is just a **string**!
>
> Hence, the code `app.use(express.json());` is going to covert that *string literal* into something like this:
>
> ```json
> {

>  "password": "1234"
> }
> ```

# Security and Authentication

> I **don't** know anything about this

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs
> - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken

## Creation Of Authentication Controller

In Django, every application has it own `views.py` file. This means that we can have a **template** ( *basically an `app.html` file* ) and its going to be rendered out when we hit the *routing*.

> This is what we are basically going to configure next!

| Django | Node - Express |
| ------ | -------------- |
| `main_project/urls.py` file | `server/server.js` file |
| `some_app/urls.py` file | `server/routes/authRoutes.js` file |
| `some_app/views.py` file | `server/controllers/authController.js` file |

> [!WARNING] Before That!
> Similarly, if you head over to `http://localhost:8000/admin`, if you have ever created some sort of 'User' table that has a *password* field... You know that if you head to the 'Admin' page.
>
> > You see that the passwords are **hashed**!
>
> Therefore, we need to install an `npm` package named 'bcryptjs' to be able to hash our user's passwords!
>
> Additionally, we are going to have to install 'jsonwebtoken'.
>
> > [!TIP] What's an Authentication Token?
> > Think of it like a badge for special access to some *special* places only.
> >
> > When our user is going to **login**, a few things is going to happen:
> >
> > - Verification of their credentials
> > - Generation of **token** ( "*digital badge*" )
> > - Send **token** to *front-end*
> >
> > The front-end will then **store** that *token* inside the user's **local storage** or **cookies**. Now, given that each user is going to have his / her own 'todos'; this has to be **protected** for each users.
> >
> > > Another user **cannot** / should **not** have *access* to another's 'todos' item!
> >
> > Now, each time the user is going to make a *requests* to a **protected endpoint** like `/api/todos`; The **token** is going to be *attached* to the **request header**!
> >
>
> Therefore, we have to install the following package from / using `npm`:
>
> ```bash
> # install the required packages for security / authentication purposes
> npm install bcryptjs jsonwebtoken
> ```

- Create a `server/controllers/authController.js` file:

```js
// import the security and authentication features
const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs");
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

// import the required knex 'server' to 'database' connection
const db = require("../db/knex");

// asynchronous function that registers a user
const register = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // get the crendentials from the 'JSON' body
    const { username, email, password, gender } = req.body;

    // if the credentials are not valid
    if (!username || !email || !password || !gender) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: "All fields are required",
      });
    }

    // check if the user already exists ( using database connection )
    const existingUser = await db("user")
      .where({ email })
      .orWhere({ username })
      .first();

    // if an already existing user tries to register again
    if (existingUser) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: "Username or email already exists",
      });
    }

    // use the `bycrypt` package to apply a hash to the password
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

    // if user does not exists and all inputs are inserted correctly ==> add the user to database
    const [userId] = await db("user").insert({
      username,
      email,
      password: hashedPassword,
      gender,
    });

    // create the digital token ( "security badge" ) for the user
    const token = jwt.sign({ userId, username }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {
      expiresIn: "7d",
    });

    // if everything has been created successfully ==> return a 'JSON' output
    // NOTE: status code = '201' ==> successful creation of a new resource on server
    res.status(201).json({

    console.error("Registration error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({

    });
  }
};

// asynchronous function that logs in a user

    const { username, password } = req.body;

    // if the credentials are not valid
    if (!username || !password) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: "Username and password are required",
      });
    }

    // find the user in the database
    const user = await db("user").where({ username }).first();

    // if user does not exists
    if (!user) {
      return res.status(401).json({
        error: "Invalid credentials",
      });
    }

    // user the 'bcrypt' package to compare the password
    // NOTE: need to user the `bycrypt.compare` function as password in DB is hashed
    const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);

    // if the password is not correct
    // NOTE: status code = '401' ==> missing / invalid / failed authentication details
    if (!isPasswordValid) {
      return res.status(401).json({
        error: "Invalid credentials",
      });
    }

    // create the digital token ( "security badge" ) for the user
    const token = jwt.sign(
      { userId: user.id, username: user.username },
      process.env.JWT_SECRET,

    // if user is able to login ==> return a 'JSON' output
    res.json({

> [!INFO] What Have We Just Done?

## Creation Of Routing For Authentication

Given that we created the *functions* that are going to be called when going to an endpoint like `/api/auth/register`. But how are we going to access that endpoint ( *from the user's perspective* )?

> Well, we have to code the **routes**?

- Create the `server/routers/authRouter.js` file:

```js
// import the 'express' library and the endpoint's function for 'register' and 'login'
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const authController = require("../controllers/authController");

// 'POST' route ==> /api/auth/register
router.post("/register", authController.register);

// 'POST' route ==> /api/auth/login
router.post("/login", authController.login);

// export the acutal routes ( `/register` and `/login` )
module.exports = router;
```

### Make The URL ( For Authentication )

Therefore, we need to actually make the routing for `/register` and `/login`. Therefore open up our `server/server.js` file and modify it so that it now looks like this:

```js
// add the 'express', 'cors' and 'dotenv' libraries
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

// simply import the data found in our `.env` file
require("dotenv").config();

// import our routers
const authRouter = require("./routers/authRouters");

// create the actual 'express' application / server
const app = express();
// define the port ( default to environment variable or '5000' )
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// define the middleware with 'cors'
// NOTE: the function that is going to allow front-end to talk with back-end
app.use(cors());

// convert front-end data into JS object
app.use(express.json());

// Routings

// test the main "landing" route
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    message: "TODO API Running!",
    status: "success",
  });
});

// authentication routes
app.use("/api/auth", authRouter);

// start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on 'http://localhost:${PORT}'`);
});
```

### Test The URL ( For Authentication )

Given that I learned a bit about the [[Python - Requests Module | `requests`]] and [[Python - JSON Module | `json`]] modules... I am going to write a little Python code that's going to allow us to test our stuff.

- Create a `main.py` inside the `todo/server` folder:

```python
import requests
import json

# base 'localhost' URL
BASE_LOCAL_URL: str = "http://localhost:5000"


# function to test the registration
def test_registration():
    register_url = f"{BASE_LOCAL_URL}/api/auth/register"

    # define the 'JSON' "payload"
    payload: dict = {
        "username": "tester",
        "email": "tester@email.com",
        "password": "password1234",
        "gender": "male",
    }

    # send / 'POST' data to server ==> get the response
    response = requests.post(register_url, json=payload)

    # display the output
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))


# function to test the login
def test_login():
    login_url = f"{BASE_LOCAL_URL}/api/auth/login"

    # define the 'JSON' "payload"
    payload: dict = {
        "username": "tester",
        "password": "password1234",
    }

    # send / 'POST' data to server ==> get the response
    response = requests.post(login_url, json=payload)

    # display the output
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))


def main():
    # register the user
    test_registration()
    # log in user
    test_login()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Create Authentication Middleware

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/middleware/what-is-middleware
> 	- https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/middleware/what-is-middleware#middleware-and-apis
> - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware

A 'Middleware' is a *function* that is going to sit in **between** a *request* and a *response*. In our case, we are going to check if the *requests* sent from the front-end is **valid** if and only if it as the 'JSON Web Token' in the *requests 'Authorisation' header*.

> [!NOTE]
> The middleware does **not** do anything when the user is going through the '**Authentication Phase**'.
>
> But it does comes into *action* when the user is going through the '**Authorisation Phase**'!

- Create the `middleware/authMiddleware.js` file:

```js
// import the 'JSON Web Token' library
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // get token from authrisation ( request ) header
    const authHeader = req.headers["authorization"];
    // split the data ( "Bearer ey12345.abc6789.xyz123" ) into 2 parts and get the token only
    const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(" ")[1];

    // if there are not token is not present
    // NOTE: status code = '401' ==> missing / invalid / failed authentication details
    if (!token) {
      return res.status(401).json({
        error: "Access denied. No token provided.",
      });
    }

    // use the `jwt.verify` function to verify token for each user
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);

    // attach / get the user information ( { userId, username } ) to the request object
    req.user = decoded;

    // continue to the actual route handler
    next();

    // NOTE: status code = '403' ==> request "valid" but unauthorised
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(403).json({
      error: "Invalid or expired token",
    });
  }
};

// export the token
module.exports = { authenticateToken };
```

# TODO Related Tasks

## Creation Of TODO Controller

Similar to how we create our `authController.js` file; we need to make our `todoController.js` file that's going to allow us to do '*CRUD*' operations with our 'TODO' items!

> Again! In Django, we would be coding the `todo/views.py` file!

- Create the `server/controllers/todoControllers.js` file:

```js
// import the "database connection"
const db = require("../db/knex");

// function to be able to create a new 'TODO' item
const createTodo = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // get the `userId` from the authentication token
    const userId = req.user.userId;

    // get the 'description' and 'category' from the body of the request
    const { description, category } = req.body;

    // if user did not add any description for the TODO item
    // NOTE: status code = '400' ==> cannot / will not process client request due to client-side error
    if (!description) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: "Description is required",
      });
    }

    // INFO: no need to validate the 'category' / 'completed' as it's going to be defaulted to 'Miscellaneous'!

    // insert the new TODO item into the database
    const [todoId] = await db("todo").insert({
      user_id: userId,
      description,
      category: category || "Miscellaneous",
      completed: false,
    });

    // get the `id` of the newly created TODO item
    // INFO: the `.first` function / method is going to only get the "first" data
    const newTodo = await db("todo").where({ id: todoId }).first();

    // if user has been able to successfully create / 'POST' TODO item on server
    // NOTE: status code = '201' ==> creation of a new resource on server
    res.status(201).json({
      message: "Todo created successfully",
      todo: newTodo,
    });

    // if the TODO item could not be inserted
    // NOTE: status code = '500' ==> internal server error
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Create todo error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: "Server error while creating todo",
    });
  }
};

// function to get all the TODO items for the logged-in user
const getTodos = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // get the `userId` from the authentication token
    const userId = req.user.userId;

    // get all of the TODO items from the database for that user in descending order of creation date
    const todos = await db("todo")
      .where({ user_id: userId })
      .orderBy("created_at", "desc");

    // get the data to the user with / using 'JSON'
    res.json({
      message: "Todos retrieved successfully",
      count: todos.length,
      todos,
    });

    // if the TODO item could not be fetched
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Get todos error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: "Server error while fetching todos",
    });
  }
};

// edit / update a TODO item
const updateTodo = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // get the `userId` from the authentication token
    const userId = req.user.userId;
    // get the TODO item's id from the parameters
    const todoId = req.params.id;
    // get the 'description', 'category' and 'completed' from the body of the request
    const { description, category, completed } = req.body;

    // check if the TODO item exists and also belongs to that user
    const todo = await db("todo")
      .where({ id: todoId, user_id: userId })
      .first();

    // if the TODO item has not been found ==> "Invoke" the famous famous '404' status code
    if (!todo) {
      return res.status(404).json({
        error: "Todo not found or does not belong to you",
      });
    }

    // update the required data for a TODO item ( to be updated )
    const updateData = {};
    if (description !== undefined) updateData.description = description;
    if (category !== undefined) updateData.category = category;
    if (completed !== undefined) updateData.completed = completed;

    // update the TODO item in the database
    await db("todo").where({ id: todoId }).update(updateData);

    // get the `id` of the updated TODO item
    const updatedTodo = await db("todo").where({ id: todoId }).first();

    // simply return a little success message
    res.json({
      message: "Todo updated successfully",
      todo: updatedTodo,
    });

    // if the TODO item could not be updated
    // NOTE: status code = '500' ==> internal server error
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Update todo error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: "Server error while updating todo",
    });
  }
};

// function to be able to delete a TODO item
const deleteTodo = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // get the `userId` from the authentication token
    const userId = req.user.userId;
    // get the TODO item's id from the parameters
    const todoId = req.params.id;

    // check if the TODO item exists and also belongs to that user
    const todo = await db("todo")
      .where({ id: todoId, user_id: userId })
      .first();

    // if the TODO item has not been found ==> "Invoke" the famous famous '404' status code
    if (!todo) {
      return res.status(404).json({
        error: "Todo not found or does not belong to you",
      });
    }

    // delete the TODO item from the database
    await db("todo").where({ id: todoId }).delete();

    // simply return a little success message
    res.json({
      message: "Todo deleted successfully",
      deletedTodo: todo,
    });

    // if the TODO item could not be updated
    // NOTE: status code = '500' ==> internal server error
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Delete todo error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: "Server error while deleting todo",
    });
  }
};

// export the functions that are going to be create to the 'CRUD' operations of TODOs
module.exports = {
  getTodos,
  createTodo,
  updateTodo,
  deleteTodo,
};
```

> [!NOTE] Update to `getTodos` function!
> I have updated the `getTodos` function so that it's going to display the 'TODO' item in **ascending** order.

## Creation Of Routing For TODO

- Create the `server/routers/todoRouters.js` file:

```js
// import the 'express' library and the endpoint's function for 'register' and 'login'
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const todoController = require("../controllers/todoController");
// NOTE: get the 'Authentication Token' as 'TODO' items are "private" to each user
const { authenticateToken } = require("../middleware/authMiddleware");

// get all TODO items for logged-in and authenticated user ( 'GET method on `/api/todos`' )
router.get("/", authenticateToken, todoController.getTodos);

// create new TODO item for logged-in and authenticated user ( 'POST method on `/api/todos`' )
router.post("/", authenticateToken, todoController.createTodo);

// update TODO item for logged-in and authenticated user ( 'PUT method on `/api/todos`' )
router.put("/:id", authenticateToken, todoController.updateTodo);

// delete TODO item for logged-in and authenticated user ( 'DELETE method on `/api/todos`' )
router.delete("/:id", authenticateToken, todoController.deleteTodo);

// export the acutal routes ( `/api/todos` )
module.exports = router;
```

### Make The URL ( For TODO )

Now, after creating that *functions* that are going to be used at at our `/api/todos` endpoints... We, hence, need to update our `server/server.js` file to be able to make requests and get a response from it.

- Update our `server.js` file to make it like so:

```js
// add the 'express', 'cors' and 'dotenv' libraries
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

// simply import the data found in our `.env` file
require("dotenv").config();

// import our routers
const authRouter = require("./routers/authRouters");
const todoRouter = require("./routers/todoRouters.js");

// create the actual 'express' application / server
const app = express();
// define the port ( default to environment variable or '5000' )
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// define the middleware with 'cors'
// NOTE: the function that is going to allow front-end to talk with back-end
app.use(cors());

// convert front-end data into JS object
app.use(express.json());

// Routings

// test the main "landing" route
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    message: "TODO API Running!",
    status: "success",
  });
});

// authentication routes
app.use("/api/auth", authRouter);

// todo routers
app.use("/api/todos", todoRouter);

// start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on 'http://localhost:${PORT}'`);
});
```

### Test The URL ( For TODO )

- Update our `main.py` file to be able to test the *function* related to 'TODO' *controllers*:

```python

# React Development Setup

We are going to be using Ant Design as much as possible. Therefore, there are some *preparation* that we are going to have **before** we start doing any real development.

## Download Required Dependencies

- Install Ant Design and 'Axios' package from `npm`:

```bash
# install 'antd' and 'axios'
npm install antd axios
```

> [!INFO]
> - `antd`: Obviously for *pre-made* designs and templates
> - `axios`: HTTP **client** to make *requests* to our 'Express.js' **back-end**

### Setup React Project To Use Ant Design

> This is going to basically the exact same thing as we have done in '[[React - Getting Started#Using Ant Design | React - Getting Started]]'.

- Add the following line of code to our `src/main.jsx` file:

```jsx
// "reset" all the CSS so that Ant Design can work
import "antd/dist/reset.css";
```

### Check If Main App Is Working

- Delete the **contents** of the following files + Delete unwanted *assets*:

```bash
# NOTE: make sure if you are in the `src/` folder... If not:
cd src

# remove the contents from `App.css` and `index.css` files
rm App.css index.css && touch App.css index.css

# delete the unwanted asset - react image
rm assets/react.svg

# change directory to where the `vite.svg` file is found
# INFO: change from current working `src/` directory to `public/` folder
cd ../public/

# delete the unwanted asset - vite image
rm vite.svg
```

- Update the `App.jsx` file to check if everything is working correctly:

```jsx
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1
        style={{
          display: "flex",
          justifyContent: "center",
          alignItems: "center",
          minHeight: "100vh",
        }}
      >
        TODO Application
      </h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- Run the development server with the following command:

```bash
# run the development server
npm run dev
```

> [!SUCCESS]
> You **should** see that you have the heading 'TODO Application' in the **middle** of your screen!

## Creation Of Folders

- Add the following folders to our `client/src` folder:

```bash
# create the following folders inside of `client/src`
mkdir context components pages services
```

> [!INFO] What are these folders for?
> - `context`: For global state management ( *'current' theme, 'TODOs'* )
> - `components`: For resuable designs / components ( *buttons, toggles* )
> - `pages`: For full page views ( *register page, login page* )
> - `services`: For handling API calls ( *to and from "our"' back-end* )

### Testing Ant Design

- Update the `src/App.jsx` file to check if Ant Designs are working correctly:

```jsx
// import a 'Card' and 'Button' component from 'antd'
import { Button, Card } from "antd";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: "20px" }}>
      <h1> TODO Application</h1>

      <Card title="Ant Design Card" style={{ width: "300" }}>
        <p> Working Ant Design Card Component!</p>

        <Button type="primary"> Ant Design Test Button</Button>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

> [!SUCCESS]
> Our `antd` is working correctly and I can see the **card** and **button** component on the page!

# Registration - Login Page

## Create Main 'Registration - Login' Page

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://react.dev/reference/react/useState
> - https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering

We are now going to code our *main* view for the **registration** - **login** page. The file `AuthPages.jsx` file is going to handle that.

Now, we are going to be creating some **forms** later on that are going to show *either* the **registration** page or the **login** page.

### Install React Icons

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons
> - https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/

- Install `react-icons` package using the following command found below:

```bash
# install the cool 'react-icons' library
npm install react-icons
```

### Example Usage

- Example of using the *an* icon from the `ri` group:

```jsx
// at the top
// import icons from 'react-icons' ( "ri" ) library
import { RiTodoLine } from "react-icons/ri";

      // code above
      <header className="auth-header">
        <nav className="auth-navbar">
          <RiTodoLine className="auth-logo" />
          <h3 className="auth-text-logo"> Act Don't React</h3>
        </nav>
      </header>
      // code below
```

## RGB Colour Shifting

I am now going to try to implement the 'RGB' colour shifting / cycle that we used in our '[[TODO Application - Pure HTML, CSS and JS]]' project!

This is the code that we are going to try to replication... Again this was written for that Project.

- This is the `index.html` file and this is **part** of the code:

```html
<!-- user is going to be able to enter his username and should be saved -->
<input id="username" type="text" placeholder="User's Name" />
```

- This is the actual implementation of the 'RGB' colour cycle:

```css
/* create a custom 'hue' property */
@property --hue {
  /* user defined 'HSL' angle / degree */
  syntax: "<angle> ";
  /* each element needs to have the 'hue' property added to it */
  inherits: false;
  /* if user does not provide a angle ==> default to '0' */
  initial-value: 0deg;
}

/* define a custom animation called `rgb-cycle` */
@keyframes rgb-cycle {
  /* initial state */
  from {
    --hue: 0deg;
  }
  /* final state */
  to {
    --hue: 360deg;
  }
}

/* add an infinite, always on RGB cycle to the user's name */
#username {
  /* define the intial colour of the text logo */
  color: hsl(var(--hue), 100%, 75%);
  /* the actual animation that will cycle infinitely */
  animation: rgb-cycle 2s linear infinite;
  /* change the font weight to be a little more bold */
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Implementation In React

Because I want to be able to **reuse** this effect on other "*things*". Therefore, I am going going to code a `<span> ` **component** that can be used and modified using *external* 'CSS'!

- Create a new component `client/src/components/RGBText.jsx`:

```jsx
function RGBText({ className, spanText }) {
  return <span className={className}> {spanText}</span> ;
}

export default RGBText;
```

- Add basically the **same** code to our `client/src/index.css` file:

```css
/* create the custom hue property */
@property --hue {
  syntax: "<angle> ";
  inherits: false;
  initial-value: 0deg;
}

/* define the custom animation called 'rgb-cycle' */
@keyframes rgb-cycle {
  from {
    --hue: 0deg;
  }
  to {
    --hue: 360deg;
  }
}
```

> [!WARNING] I did all of this but I am **not** going to use it
> > Yet!
>
> My friend told me that the RGB effect is dumb and **unreadable** in the *light mode* / theme!
>
> He is telling me to basically when the user is going to switch to the *dark mode* version... Its then that "*something*" is going to have the 'RGB' cycle effect.

## Logo Animation

I wanted a little animation on the page, there go ahead and add this to your `src/index.css` file:

```css
/* define the custom animation called 'move-up-down' */
@keyframes move-up-down {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(2px);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(-2px);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(2px);
  }
}
```

- Applying that to the whole logo 'Act Don't React':

```css
.auth-navbar:hover,
.auth-navbar:focus-visible {
  animation: move-up-down 1s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

### Updated Error Message To Use Message Component

Thanks to Girik, I have been able to update my `InputDisplayTodo.jsx` ( *you are going to come across this file later* ) to add the `message` component by Ant Design.

Therefore, I am here to update the `errorMessage` and `setErrorMessage` to *convert* them to use `messageApi` instead!

- Import the `message` component from Ant Design:

```jsx
// import components from 'antd'
import { Button, Form, Input, Select, message } from "antd";
```

- Create variable that is going to have access to `.useMessage` from the `message` component:

```jsx
// declare variable to be able to use the `message` component
const [messageApi, contextHolder] = message.useMessage();
```

- Add to all required functions:

> Using `handleLogin` as example...

```jsx
  // function to handle the login of users
  const handleLogin = async (values) => {
    // change the 'loading' state to true
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await apiLogin(values);

      // Use context method to set authentication state
      login(response.token);
      console.log(`Values = ${values}`);

      // display a little 'success' message to the user
      console.log("Logged in user:", response.user);

      // navigate to the dashboard route
      navigate("/homepage");
    } catch (error) {
      // if any errors occur during the registration process
      if (error.response) {
        // server side errors
        if (error.response.status === 401) {
          messageApi.open({
            type: "error",
            content: "Invalid credentials",
            duration: 1,
          });

          // if user did not fill the form correctly
        } else if (error.response.status === 400) {
          messageApi.open({
            type: "error",
            content: "Please fill in all required fields",
            duration: 1,
          });
        } else {
          // if anything else happened
          messageApi.open({
            type: "error",
            content: "An error occurred during login",
            duration: 1,
          });
        }

        // requests sent but no response
      } else if (error.request) {
        messageApi.open({
          type: "error",
          content: "Network error - please check your connection",
          duration: 1,
        });
        // if anything else happened
      } else {
        messageApi.open({
          type: "error",
          content: "Invalid Credentials",
          duration: 1,
        });
      }
      console.error("Login error:", error);

      // change the loading status back to `false`
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
```

- Therefore to be able to use it:

```jsx
return (
<>
  {contextHolder}
  // other codes here
</>
```

# Axios API Connection

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://axios-http.com/
> 	- https://axios-http.com/docs/intro

## Create API Service

We are now going to create the API that is going to allow us to connect to the 'Express.js' back-end.

- Create the `client/src/services/api.js` file:

```js
// import the 'axios' library to connect front-end to back-end
import axios from "axios";

// our base URL for the back-end ( API )
const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000/api";

// create axios instance with default configuration
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});

// add the token to the requests automaticlaly if it exists ( gets the token from local storage )
api.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
    if (token) {
      config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    }
    return config;
  },
  // if the token has not been found --> reject the user's request
  (error) => {
    return Promise.reject(error);
  },
);

// register a new user ( endpoint )
export const register = async (userData) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.post("/auth/register", userData);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error.response?.data || { error: "Registration failed" };
  }
};

// login a new user ( endpoint )
// NOTE: the `crendentials` parameters is basically the 'JSON' object
export const login = async (credentials) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.post("/auth/login", credentials);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error.response?.data || { error: "Login failed" };
  }
};

// get all TODOs for logged-in user ( endpoint )
export const getTodos = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await api.get("/todos");
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error.response?.data || { error: "Failed to fetch todos" };
  }
};

// create a new TODO for logged-in user ( endpoint )
export const createTodo = async (todoData) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.post("/todos", todoData);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error.response?.data || { error: "Failed to create todo" };
  }
};

// update ( a ) TODO for logged-in user ( endpoint )
export const updateTodo = async (todoId, todoData) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.put(`/todos/${todoId}`, todoData);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error.response?.data || { error: "Failed to update todo" };
  }
};

// delete ( a ) TODO for logged-in user ( endpoint )
export const deleteTodo = async (todoId) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.delete(`/todos/${todoId}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error.response?.data || { error: "Failed to delete todo" };
  }
};

// export the actual connection
export default api;
```

> [!INFO] What is this doing?
> - Create an 'Axios' instance which is a pre-configured HTTP client
> - Automatically adds the 'JSON' web token ( *if available* )
> 	- If the 'JWT' is **not** available then "*reject*" the user's requests

## Connect React - Forms To API

To be able connect the *forms* ( "*data*" ) to our back-end; we are going to have to update our `client/src/pages/AuthPages.jsx` file.

- Import `ConfigProvider` and `message` component from `antd` into `main.jsx` file:

```jsx
// import `ConfigProvider` and `message` from 'antd'
import { ConfigProvider, message } from "antd";

// configure message globally
message.config({
  top: 100,
  duration: 3,
  maxCount: 3,
});

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <ConfigProvider>
      <App />
    </ConfigProvider>
  </StrictMode> ,
);
```

- Import `message` component from `antd` into `pages/AuthPages.jsx` file:

```jsx
// import components from 'antd'
import { Button, Form, Input, Select, message } from "antd";
```

- Import the API function itself ( *i.e our `client/src/services/api.js` file* ):

```jsx
// import the API function that will talk to back-end
import { register, login } from "../services/api";
```

- Create a `loading` state for when the user is going to press the "*respective*" button:

```jsx
  // declare "variable" to show 'loading' state
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
```

- Function that are actually going to **use** the `register` and `login` function from `client/src/services/api.js` file:

> Which in turn is going to be making our requests to 'Express.js' back-end

```jsx
  // function to handle the registration of users
  const handleRegister = async (values) => {
    // change the 'loading' state to true
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await register(values);

      // once 'crendentials' of user "appeared" ==> save the token for user in local storage
      localStorage.setItem("token", response.token);

      // display a little 'success' message to the user
      message.success("Registration successful!");
      console.log("Registered user:", response.user);

      // BUG: still need to redirect the user
    } catch (error) {
      message.error(error.error || "Registration failed. Please try again.");
      console.error("Registration error:", error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  // function to handle the login of users
  const handleLogin = async (values) => {
    // change the 'loading' state to true
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await login(values);

      // once 'crendentials' of user "appeared" ==> save the token for user in local storage
      localStorage.setItem("token", response.token);

      // display a little 'success' message to the user
      message.success("Login successful!");
      console.log("Logged in user:", response.user);

      // BUG: still need to redirect the user
    } catch (error) {
      message.error(error.error || "Login failed. Please try again.");
      console.error("Login error:", error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
```

> [!WARNING]
> We still need to modify the `handleRegister` and `handleLogin` function to be able to **redirect** the user to the "*home*" page / dashboard.
>
> > The above mentioned step is going to allow us to learn 'React Routing'!
>

- Update the front-end to make use of these functions and *spinner* loading:

```jsx
              <Form layout="vetical" onFinish={handleLogin}>
```

```jsx
              <Form layout="vetical" onFinish={handleRegister}>
```

- Updated the **both** `Button` component to add the loading spinner:

```jsx
                <Button
                  className="register-button"
                  type="primary"
                  htmlType="submit"
                  block
                  size="large"
                  loading={loading}
                >
                  Sign Up
                </Button>
```

### Testing Front-End And Back-End Connection ( Register / Login )

- Run the **front-end** server:

```bash
# make sure that you are in the `client/` folder
# then run the front-end server
npm run dev
```

- Run the **back-end** server:

```bash
# make sure that you are in the `server/` folder
# then run the back-end server
npm run dev
```

> [!WARNING] It Works But...
> The `message` component from `antd` is **not** compatible with the latest version of React!

## Creation Of Main Page

We are now going to create our main page that's going to be basically the whole web-app.

This page is going to be our "*main*" thing. That is, its going to have:

- Top bar
- User greetings and weather
- TODOs
	- Input
	- Display
- AI
	- Input
	- Display

### Routes!!!

Compared to regular 'HTML' whereby we can use the `href` tag to be able to *go to* another page.

> Here is completely different as we need to use **routes**!

To be able to *switch* to other pages, we are going to first install the `react-router-dom` package.

- Install the `react-router-dom` to be able to use routes:

```bash
# install the 'react-router-dom' to be able to "switch" pages
npm install react-router-dom
```

### Create The Actual Dashboard File

- Create the `client/src/pages/Homepage.jsx` file:

```jsx
function Homepage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1> Main Page</h1>
      <p> Logged In</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Homepage;
```

> [!NOTE]
> We are just testing to see if the routing is going to work right now. Its later that we are going to be focusing on the UI!

### Add The Routings

- Update the `client/src/App.jsx` file to be like this:

```jsx
// import required routing component from 'react-router-dom' library
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Navigate } from "react-router-dom";

// import our Components
import AuthPages from "./pages/AuthPages";
import Homepage from "./pages/Homepage";

// import a 'Card' and 'Button' component from 'antd'
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  // check if the user has been logged in
  const isAuthenticated = !!localStorage.getItem("token");
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      {/* create the individual routes */}
      <Routes>
        {/* route for the login page ( go to homepage if already logged in) */}
        <Route
          path="/"
          element={
            isAuthenticated ? <Navigate to="/homepage" /> : <AuthPages />
          }
        />

        <Route
          element={isAuthenticated ? <Homepage /> : <Navigate to="/" /> }
          path="/homepage"
        />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- Update the `client/src/pages/AuthPages.jsx` file:

```jsx
// import the `useNavigate` component from 'react-router-dom'
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

// other codes

  // declare "variable" to show error messages
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState("");

  // ADD THIS
  // declare variable to be able to use the `useNavigate` function
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  // function to handle the registration of users
  const handleRegister = async (values) => {
  
// other codes

	  // USE IT LIKE SO
      // navigate to the dashboard route
      navigate("/homepage");
      
      // BUG: not really satified with this solution
      window.location.reload();
      
// other codes

	  // USE IT INSIDE `login` NOW
      // navigate to the dashboard route
      navigate("/homepage");
```

> [!WARNING] `window.location.reload()`!
> This is really **not** optimal but this is the only that is solving the problem of the route.

#### Using Context To Solve The `window.location.reload()` Issue

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext
> - https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html ( "*deprecated*" )
> - https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect

> [!TIP] What is a Context?
> Before we go ahead an understand what the hell is a 'Context'... We need to first understand what are *props*.
>
> > [!TIP] What are Props?
> > - Parameters!
> >
> > They are simply **parameters** that are passed to *components*. The problem in our "*context*" ( *get it... our context...* ), they are many places where we *would* need to pass parameters into parameters.
> >
> > Therefore, this is the main reason as to why we use **contexts**. Think of them like *global state management*.
>
> A **context** is going to allow us to **share** data to *multiple* components ( *without the use of props* )!
>
> In this case, we are going to use a *global* state that is going to handle the **creation** and **deletion** of the `token` in our `localStorage` by providing us with *functions* to be able to do so!

- Create `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` file:

```jsx
// import the required "routing" component from the 'react' library
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from "react";

// create the context for the authentication
const AuthContext = createContext();

// Custom hook to use the AuthContext
// own custom 'hook' that is going to use the `AuthContext` context
export const useAuth = () => {
  // create another context inside of `useAuth`
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);

  // if not found within and 'AuthProvider'
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error("useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider");
  }
  return context;
};

// the actual 'AuthProvider' resuable component
export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // declare variables that is going to check if `token` key exists in local storage
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(

# Main Pages Components

## Creating The MVP

We are now going to create basically the main *thing* of our application.

### Our Main ( Home ) Page

I am now going to be updating our `client/src/pages/Homepage.jsx` file, but because the file is really long ( *that's what she said* ). I am **not** going to be *pasting* the whole thing here!

> Instead of I am just going to show you parts of it!

- Our required imports:

```jsx
// import the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks from 'react'
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

// import the `useAuth` function from `AuthContext.jsx`
import { useAuth } from "../contexts/AuthContext";

// import the following components from 'antd'
import { Button, Card, Checkbox, Form, Input, List, Select } from "antd";

// import the API function that will talk to back-end
import { createTodo, getTodos, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from "../services/api";

// import the `useNavigate` component from 'react-router-dom'
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

// import the styling the for our homepage component
import "./Homepage.css";
```

- Definition / Declaration of variables ( *inside the "main" `Homepage()` function* ):

```jsx
  // get the `logout` function
  const { logout } = useAuth();

  // variable that is going to allow us to navigate to other pages
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  // states for our TODO items
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
  const [todoFetchLoading, setTodoFetchLoading] = useState(false);
  const [form] = Form.useForm();
```

- Functions defined inside of `Homepage()`:

```jsx
  // function that is going to fetch / get TODOs from the database
  const fetchTodos = async () => {
    setTodoFetchLoading(true);

    try {
      // get the response / TODO ( `id` ) from the database
      const response = await getTodos();

      // get the user's TODOs if not present return an empty list
      setTodos(response.todos || []);

      // if some error while fetching TODOs occurs
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error while fetching TODOs: ${error}`);

      // change the loading status back to `false`
    } finally {
      setTodoFetchLoading(false);
    }
  };

  // fetch the TODOs when the components loads up ( from the database )
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTodos();
  }, []);

  const handleCreateTodo = async (values) => {
    try {
      // wait for the database to finish writing TODO items
      const response = await createTodo(values);

      // display a little message inside the console
      console.log("Todo Created");

      // add the new TODO item to the list ==> to be rendered out
      setTodos([response.todo, ...todos]);

      // create the form for new input of TODO item
      form.resetFields();

      // if there was any errors while creation of TODO item
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error while creating TODOs: ${error}`);
    }
  };

  // function to "check-off" TODO items
  const handleToggleComplete = async (todoId, currentStatus) => {
    try {
      // run the `updateTodo` function and "inverse" the current `completed` status
      const response = await updateTodo(todoId, {
        completed: !currentStatus,
      });

      // update "that" TODO item in the list using its `id`
      setTodos(
        todos.map((todo) => (todo.id === todoId ? response.todo : todo)),
      );

      // display a little message
      console.log("Todo Updated ( Check Off Function )");

      // if any error happends when "checking-off" a TODO item
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error updating todo: ${error}`);
    }
  };

  // function to delete TODO items
  const handleDeleteTodo = async (todoId) => {
    try {
      // run the `deleteTodo` function on a specific TODO item
      await deleteTodo(todoId);

      // Remove todo from the list
      setTodos(todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== todoId));

      // display a little message
      console.log("Todo deleted!");

      // if there are any errors that occurs during deletion
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error deleting todo: ${error}`);
    }
  };

  // function to be able to logout the user
  const handleLogout = () => {
    // call the logout function
    logout();

    // go back to the login - register page
    navigate("/");
  };
```

- The Main 'JSX' *front-end* part:

```jsx
  return (
    <div className="homepage-container">
      {/* Simple header with logout */}
      <div className="homepage-header">
        <h1> My TODOs</h1>

      {/* Create TODO Form */}
      <Card title="Create New TODO" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>

          >
            <Input.TextArea placeholder="E.g., Fix the login bug..." rows={3} />
          </Form.Item>

          <Form.Item

```

## Creating A New Branch

Given that we now have our 'MVP'; I am going to create a new branch whereby I can *break* the `Homepage.jsx` file and then learn a bit on my own instead of relying / understanding codes that 'LLMs' are giving me.

- Create a new branch ( *and switch to it* ) with the name `test`:

```bash
# create a new branch named `test`
git switch -c test
```

- Push the local `test` branch to **remote**:

```bash
# commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit on `test` branch"

# push the changes / whole branch
git push -u origin test
```

# Learn How To Use Postman

> Not the guy that delivers your letters!

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://www.postman.com/

> [!TIP]
> Instead of using Python scripts to *test* our **outputs**... We can simply use a powerful tool like 'Postman' to be able to get these **same** *outputs* but in a more clean and effective way.
>
> Also its good that every one in their mother know how to use this!

## Login Post Requests

- Given that this is our **base URL** ( *server side's "port"* ):

```console
http://localhost:5000
```

Let us say that we now want to know the 'JSON' output that we get when the `test` user logs into our web-app. Here are the steps that you should follow to be able to do just that.

- Make sure that you are doing a <span style="color: #FEE37E;"> POST</span> request
- Endpoint URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login`
- Change the `Content-Type` from `text/plain` to `application/json` ( *simply create another key pair value* )
- Add the following content to the body:

	```json
	{
		"username": "test",
		"password": "1234",
	}
	```

- Simply press the <button> Send</button> button
- Therefore you should see something like this:

	```json
	{
    "message": "Login successful",
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjUsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdCIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzAxMTE3OCwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNjE1OTc4fQ.71ryQevORVhAzXUa5cMsbzszYDObdJwPATPiy_zSI80",
    "user": {
        "id": 5,
        "username": "test",
        "email": "test@gmail.com",
        "gender": "male"
		}
	}
	```

> [!INFO]- We are going to be using that `token`!
> We are going to be using this very `token` value that we got:
>
> ```console
> eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjUsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdCIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzAxMTE3OCwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNjE1OTc4fQ.71ryQevORVhAzXUa5cMsbzszYDObdJwPATPiy_zSI80
> ```

## TODO Get Requests

Similarly, let's say that we want to be able to list out all the 'TODO' items that a user has created; therefore, we can make a `GET` requests to *that* endpoint and therefore get all the 'TODO' item created by that user.

Follow the steps below to be able to achieve this:

- Make sure that you are doing a <span style="color: #6BDD9A;"> GET</span> request
- Endpoint URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/todos`
- Change the `Content-Type` from `text/plain` to `application/json` ( *simply create another key pair value* )
- Change the 'Authorization' **type** to be 'Bearer Token'
	- Then simply paste the user's *token* value there!

- Therefore in my case, I see this as output:

```json
{
    "message": "Todos retrieved successfully",
    "count": 2,
    "todos": [
        {
            "id": 5,
            "description": "Test's Coding TODO Item\n\n- Create a new branch\n- Push new branch to remote",
            "category": "Deployment",
            "completed": 0,
            "created_at": "2025-11-13 04:48:46",
            "updated_at": "2025-11-13 04:48:46",
            "user_id": 5
        },
        {
            "id": 4,
            "description": "Test's TODO Item",
            "category": "Testing",
            "completed": 1,
            "created_at": "2025-11-13 04:48:14",
            "updated_at": "2025-11-13 04:48:14",
            "user_id": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

# Create Username Component

I am now going to create a "*username*" component that's going to fetch **display** the user's *username*. Originally, I was just going to make / use a simple `<input> ` tag.

But there is a massive issue with this... "*Why do that*?". We already have the user's *username* in the **database**. Therefore we are going to create another controller ( *remember its just a function interacting with database* ) and make its specific **route** whereby the front-end is going to *hit* that **endpoint**.

## Back-End / Express.JS

- Create the `server/controller/userController.js` file:

```js
// import the required knex 'server' to 'database' connection
const db = require("../db/knex");

// asynchronous function that will fetch the user's username
const getUserProfile = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // get the user's ID from the user ( using authentication token )
    const userId = req.user.userId;

    // get the user's profile from the database
    const userProfile = await db("user")
      .select("id", "username", "gender", "created_at")
      .where({ id: userId })
      .first();

    // if the user has not been found ( on the database )
    if (!userProfile) {
      // send the famous, famous '404' error
      return res.status(404).json({
        error: "User not found",
      });
    }

    // send the whole user ( profile ) data as the response
    res.json({
      message: "User profile successfully retrieved",
      user: {
        id: userProfile.id,
        username: userProfile.username,
        gender: userProfile.gender,
        createdAt: userProfile.created_at,
      },
    });

    // if the user could not be authenticated
    // NOTE: status code = '500' ==> internal server error
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Get Profile Error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: "Server error during login",
    });
  }
};

// export the function to be used by others
module.exports = {
  getUserProfile,
};
```

- Create the `server/routers/userRouters.js` file:

```js
// import the 'express' library and function for user at endpoint
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const userController = require("../controllers/userController");

// NOTE: get the 'Authentication Token' as 'TODO' items are "private" to each user
const { authenticateToken } = require("../middleware/authMiddleware");

// get the user profile details
router.get("/user", authenticateToken, userController.getUserProfile);

// export the actual routes ( `/api/user/{functionName}` )
module.exports = router;
```

- Update the `server/server.js` file:

```js
// other imports above

// import our routers
const authRouter = require("./routers/authRouters.js");
const todoRouter = require("./routers/todoRouters.js");
const userRouter = require("./routers/userRouters.js");

// other codes below

// authentication routes
app.use("/api/auth", authRouter);

// todo routers
app.use("/api/todos", todoRouter);

// user routers
app.use("/api/user", userRouter);

// other codes below
```

### Testing With Postman

We know that the **base** URL is going to be `http://localhost:5000/api/user`. Therefore, we just need to make a `GET` request and we **should** see the user details.

Additionally, as this is a *protected* area; we are going to have to add the 'Bearer Token' to Postman. Given that I am already logged in the browser, I am just going  to head to the local storage and *yoink* that `token` value there.

- This is what I get for *my* user when I do a `GET` request:

```json
{
    "message": "User profile successfully retrieved",
    "user": {
        "id": 5,
        "username": "test",
        "gender": "male",
        "createdAt": "2025-11-13 04:47:50"
    }
}
```

## Front-End / React

- Create / *Update* our `client/src/components/Username.jsx` file:

```jsx
// import the `useState` and `useEffect` function from 'react' library
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

// import the API function that will talk to back-end
import { getUserProfile } from "../services/api";

function Username({ className }) {
  // declare variable that is going to hold the username
  const [username, setUsername] = useState("");

  // declare variable to keep track of "loading"
  const [userFetchLoading, setUserFetchLoading] = useState(true);

  // function that is going to fetch / get user details from the database
  const fetchProfile = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await getUserProfile();

      setUsername(response.user.username);

      // if the user profile / username could not be fetch from database
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to fetch user's username: ${error}`);

      // if the data could not be retrieved
    } finally {
      setUserFetchLoading(false);
    }
  };

  // fetch the TODOs when the components loads up ( from the database )
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProfile();
  }, []);

  // conditional way to display the username
  if (userFetchLoading) {
    // if the username has been NOT retrieved
    return <span className={className}> Loading...</span> ;
  }

  // else if the username HAS been retrieved from the database
  return <span className={className}> {username}</span> ;
}

// export as reusable component
export default Username;
```

- Test our component by simply adding it ( *in a random place* ) in our `client/src/pages/Homepage.jsx` file:

```jsx
<h1>
	<Username />
</h1>
```

### Update: Adding Greetings

Remember how we add a "*random greetings*" in our "*pure*" 'HTML', 'CSS' and 'JS' TODO project?

> For more information visit the file / note: '[[TODO Application - Pure HTML, CSS and JS#Display Random Greetings | TODO Application - Pure HTML, CSS and JS]]'

Therefore I am going to be **updating** our `<Username /> ` component to basically be the same as the above.

- Create the actual `greetings` list and random ( index ) variable:

```jsx
  // declare array of "greetings"
  const greetings = [
    "Welcome Back",
    "Hello",
    "Hi",
    "Hey",
    "Greetings",
    "Howdy",
    "Salutations",
    "Good day",
    "Aloha",
    "Bonjour",
    "Hola",
    "G'day",
  ];
  
  // get a random number ( upper bound ==> length of array )
  const greetIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * greetings.length);
```

- Therefore updated our *last* `return` statement:

```jsx
  // else if the username HAS been retrieved from the database
  return (
    <span className={className}>
      {greetings[greetIndex]} {username}
    </span>
  );
```

> [!SUCCESS]
> Therefore you should see that there are some *greetings* that are shown **before** the username and if you refresh the page.
>
> You should see that the *greetings* changes!

# Create Profile Picture - Drop Down Menu Component

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ2kqc0eep8
> - https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef
> 	- https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef#manipulating-the-dom-with-a-ref

> [!WARNING] Only showing parts of it!!!
> Please refer to the actual `ProfileMenu.jsx` for the whole implementation. I am only going to be showing *pieces* of it here!

## Make It Behave Like Ant Design's Component

As you already know by now; Ant Design provides us with **premade** designs. But we can easily use the `className` attribute to be able to further customise.

> I don't really need to do this but I want to learn how to do this!

So I want to have a **predefined** styling and then we can also change the styling somewhere else. Given that I know that we have to use the `||` / "*or*" syntax but I don't really know how to actually code it. Therefore, I asked [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) from [opencode](https://opencode.ai/) to show me hows its done.

> I am basically updating my code to allow *handling* the different class names.

```jsx
// declare variable that is going to handle the "custom" `className`
const customClassName = `profile-menu-component ${className || ""}`.trim();

return <div className={customClassName} {...props}> </div> ;
```

As you can see, we use `...props` with the *spread* operator that is going to allow us to pass **multiple** *arguments*.

> The "*thing*" that is related to the parent-child passing down of arguments.

As you can see we are using a default `className` of `profile-menu-component` if the *place* we are using that component does **not** add any custom `className`; then its going to use the *default* styling of `ProfileMenu.jsx`.

But if the user is enters a "*custom*" class name of `custom-profile-thing`; then the `className` is going to actually be `profile-menu-component custom-profile-thing`.

> Yes! Yes you can do this!

In 'CSS', we know that ( *I found that from using Django* ) the **order** of the actual *stylesheet* is important.

> For example, the `src/index.css` file is going to have **precedence** over `App.css`!

But you can do something similar with this using `className`. Additionally, this is <strong> <span style="color: red;"> not</span> </strong> a 'React' specific syntax. This actually exists in simple 'CSS'!

> "*The more you know...*"

## Making The Card

This is how we made the contents / components to be shown inside the card.

```jsx
// other codes above

  // get the `logout` function
  const { logout } = useAuth();

  // variable that is going to allow us to navigate to other pages
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  // function to be able to logout the user
  const handleLogout = () => {
    // call the logout function
    logout();

    // go back to the login - register page
    navigate("/");
  };

  // declare the menus that are going to be present upon hover / click
  const profileMenus = [
    <Button onClick={handleLogout} danger>
      Logout
    </Button> ,
  ];

// other codes here

        <div className="profile-menu-card" ref={profileMenusRef}>
          <ul>
            {profileMenus.map((menuItem) => (
              <li
                className="profile-menu-items"
                key={menuItem}
                onClick={() => setOpen(false)}
              >
                {menuItem}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
		
// other codes below
```

This is how we made the *card* to show on **mouse hover** and also on **mouse click** and also close *only* on **mouse click**.

```jsx
// other codes above

  // variable to check if profile is opened
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  // create "reference" to the DOM for the whole menu and image
  const profileMenusRef = useRef(null);
  const imageRef = useRef(null);

  // function that is going to make use of `useEffect` to be able to close menu when click elsewhere
  const handleOutsideClick = (e) => {
    if (profileMenusRef.current && imageRef.current) {
      if (
        !profileMenusRef.current.contains(e.target) &&
        !imageRef.current.contains(e.target)
      ) {
        setOpen(false);
      }
    }
  };

  // talk to the browser / external resources
  useEffect(() => {
    // close the profile "card" if already open
    document.addEventListener("click", handleOutsideClick);

    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener("click", handleOutsideClick);
    };
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className={customClassName} {...props}>
      <img
        ref={imageRef}
        className="profile-picture"
        src={profilePicture}
        onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}
        onMouseOver={() => setOpen(!open)}
      />

      {open && (
        <div className="profile-menu-card" ref={profileMenusRef}>
          <ul>
            {profileMenus.map((menuItem) => (
              <li
                className="profile-menu-items"
                key={menuItem}
                onClick={() => setOpen(false)}
              >
                {menuItem}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
  
// other codes below
```

### Toggle Page Width

Given that in our `index.css` file we have the following:

```css
/* style the whole HTML tag */
html {
  max-width: 100%;
  margin: auto;
}
```

If you go ahead and play with the `max-width` property; you are going to see that *whole* `Homepage.jsx` page is going to be more in the **middle**.

Therefore, I want to update our profile menu so that it has a *settings* to be able to toggle the width from 70% to 100% and back.

- Update `client/src/index.css` file add variable for page width:

```css
/* add variable to 'root' */
:root {
	/* other codes */
	--page-width: 100%;
}

/* other codes */

/* update styling for 'html' property */
/* style the whole HTML tag */
html {
  max-width: var(--page-width);
  margin: auto;
}
```

- Create the function that will interact with our "*root*" in our `ProfileMenu.jsx` file:

```jsx
  // function to be able to toggle the whole width of the page
  const handleWidthToggle = () => {
    // current value of `--page-width` variable
    const currentWidth = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)
      .getPropertyValue("--page-width")
      .trim();

    // compare current value to "set" value ( by first setting the initial value with `currentWidth`)
    const setWidth = currentWidth === "100%" ? "80%" : "100%";

    // change the value of the width by setting the new value
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--page-width", setWidth);
  };

  // declare the menus that are going to be present upon hover / click
  const profileMenus = [
    <p onClick={handleLogout}> Logout</p> ,
	// Add the following line below
    <p onClick={handleWidthToggle}> Toggle Width</p> ,
  ];
```

### Show Only On Big Devices

When looking at the page from a small devices such as a smartphone, if we use our newly created 'Toggle Width' "*button*", it just messes with everything.

Because my 'CSS' styling for *responsiveness* is pretty good right now. I don't want to touch it. Hence, I was thinking that we should completely remove the 'Toggle Width' button on 'non-desktop' computers.

- Create a new folder called 'hooks' under `src`:

```bash
# NOTE: make sure that you are in the 'client/src' folder

# create a new folder 'hooks'
mkdir hooks
```

- Create `client/src/hooks/useMediaQuery.js` file:

```js
// import the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks from 'react'
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

// custom hook that takes a string ( a CSS media query )
export const useMediaQuery = (query) => {
  // set the initial value to that query
  const [matches, setMatches] = useState(window.matchMedia(query).matches);

  // listen to any changes made to `query`
  useEffect(() => {
    const media = window.matchMedia(query);

    const listener = (e) => {
      setMatches(e.matches);
    };

    // add an event listener that is going to respond to change
    media.addEventListener("change", listener);

    // remove the event listener once complete
    return () => media.removeEventListener("change", listener);
  }, [query]);

  // returnn the actual value
  return matches;
};
```

- Therefore, update our `ProfileMenu.jsx` file:

> [!WARNING] Completed Changed!
> Please refer to the actual `ProfileMenu.jsx` file in the code as there has been many *good* changes.

> [!SUCCESS]
> Now the 'Toggle Width' button only shows when the user is on a big screen!

# Toggle Theme ( Button / Toggle )

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext
> - https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext

Most people from what I can see on YouTube ( *by most I mean the popular videos* ) are using 'DOM' to be able to access them. But one of the developers told me that it's going to be better if I use **contexts**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **official** documentation also provides and example of '*Toggle Theme*'.
>
> > See above links!
>
> So this is what I am going to be using then...

## Theme Context

- Create the `client/src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx` file:

```jsx
// import the required components from the 'react' library
import { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from "react";

// create the context for the theme
const ThemeContext = createContext(null);

// own custom 'hook' that is going to use the `ThemeContext` context
export const useTheme = () => {
  // use the context inside of `useTheme`
  const context = useContext(ThemeContext);

  // if not found within and 'ThemeProvider'
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error("useTheme must be used within ThemeProvider");
  }

  // return the context globally
  return context;
};

// the actual `ThemeProvider` resuable component
export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // declare variables that is going to check if `theme` key exists in local storage
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(() => {
    // if `theme` key does not exists ==> set the `theme` variable ( or key ) to 'light'
    return localStorage.getItem("theme") || "light";
  });

  // function to be able to toggle the theme ==> main function to be used by components
  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light");
  };

  // use the `useEffect` function / component to be able to see external changes from local storage
  useEffect(() => {
    // change / update the `theme` key with the current value / theme
    localStorage.setItem("theme", theme);

    // change the styling of the actual 'HTML' tags to use the "proper" colours
    document.documentElement.classList.remove("light", "dark");
    document.documentElement.classList.add(theme);
  }, [theme]);

  // allow others to use the `value` object
  const value = { theme, toggleTheme };

  // setup `ThemeProvider` so that all components are able to use context
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={value}> {children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

- Update our `client/src/main.jsx` file to use the `ThemeProvider`:

```jsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

// import `ConfigProvider` from 'antd'
import { ConfigProvider } from "antd";

// import ThemeContext
import { ThemeProvider } from "./contexts/ThemeContext";

// "reset" all the CSS so that Ant Design can work
import "antd/dist/reset.css";

import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <ConfigProvider>
      <ThemeProvider>
        <App />
      </ThemeProvider>
    </ConfigProvider>
  </StrictMode> ,
);
```

## Create Actual Toggle Theme Component

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/

- This is the implementation of the `ToggleTheme.jsx` component:

```jsx
// import the `Button` component from 'antd'
import { Button } from "antd";

// import the `useAuth` function from `AuthContext.jsx`
import { useTheme } from "../contexts/ThemeContext";

// import icons from 'react-icons' ( "ai" ) library
import { AiFillMoon, AiFillSun } from "react-icons/ai";

// add the required styling to toggle theme button
import "./ToggleTheme.css";

function ToggleTheme({ className }) {
  // get the `theme` and `toggleTheme` function
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();

  // function to be able to toggle the theme
  const handleToggleTheme = () => {
    // call the `toggleTheme` function
    toggleTheme();
  };

  // the actual component that is going to be returned
  return (
    <Button
      // implement the "custom" 'antd' class name
      className={`theme-toggle-button ${className || ""}`.trim()}
      onClick={handleToggleTheme}
      icon={theme === "light" ? <AiFillSun /> : <AiFillMoon /> }
      type="primary"
      size="large"
    >
      {/* "write" 'Light' when on light theme and vice versa ( for dark theme ) */}
      {theme === "light" ? "Light" : "Dark"}
    </Button>
  );
}

// export as reusable component
export default ToggleTheme;
```

- Styling for the `ToggleTheme` component:

```css
.theme-toggle-button {
  min-width: 5rem;
  height: 2.3rem;
  background-color: var(--primary);
  color: white;
  border: none;
  transition: var(--transition);
}

.theme-toggle-button:hover {
  background-color: var(--secondary);
  transform: scale(1.05);
}

.theme-toggle-button:active {
  transform: scale(0.95);
}

.theme-toggle-button .anticon {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}
```

# Create TODO Form Component

## But Before Ant Design!!!

Originally, I was using Ant Design's components for things like the 'Logout'. But then I implemented the 'Toggle Theme' button.

> Switching the page to 'Dark Mode'; The Ant's component did **not** switch!

Therefore, I reverted back to using simple `<li> ` and `<p> ` tags. But then the developers told me that there is a way to be able to do that and given that I already have my `ThemeContext.jsx` file in my 'contexts' folder... [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com).

- Create the `src/AppWithProviders.jsx` file:

```jsx
// import `ConfigProvider`, `antdTheme` component, hook from 'antd'
import { ConfigProvider, theme as antdTheme } from "antd";

// import the theme provider and custom hook from 'ThemeContext.jsx'
import { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from "./contexts/ThemeContext";

// import the actual "main" react application
import App from "./App.jsx";

// get the required algorithm from 'antd'
const { defaultAlgorithm, darkAlgorithm } = antdTheme;

function AntdThemedApp() {
  // get the current theme
  const { theme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <ConfigProvider
      theme={{
        // switch the theme for the 'antd' components depending on the current theme
        algorithm: theme === "dark" ? darkAlgorithm : defaultAlgorithm,
      }}
    >
      <App />
    </ConfigProvider>
  );
}

// return the function that is going to wrap everything
export default function AppWithProviders() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <AntdThemedApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

- Update our `main.jsx` file:

```jsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

// "reset" all the CSS so that Ant Design can work
import "antd/dist/reset.css";

import "./index.css";

// import the actual react application
import AppWithProviders from "./AppWithProviders.jsx";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <AppWithProviders />
  </StrictMode> ,
);
```

> [!SUCCESS]

## The Select Component And Back-End Category

Currently for the 'TODO' `category`, I am asking the user to select from a *number of items* that we have from the database but not really!

- This is the `.enu` that is used inside the `server/db/migrations/<DateTime> _create_todos_table.js` file:

```js
table
  .enu("category", [
	"Code Review",
	"Coding",
	"Debugging",
	"Deployment",
	"Documentation",
	"Learning",
	"Meeting",
	"Miscellaneous",
	"Planning",
	"Refactoring",
	"Testing",
  ])
  .defaultTo("Miscellaneous");
```

- Therefore in the front-end over at `client/src/components/InputDisplayTodo.jsx`, we are using the `Select` component from 'antd':

```jsx
<Select placeholder="Select category">
  <Select.Option value="Code Review"> Code Review</Select.Option>
  <Select.Option value="Coding"> Coding</Select.Option>
  <Select.Option value="Debugging"> Debugging</Select.Option>
  <Select.Option value="Deployment"> Deployment</Select.Option>
  <Select.Option value="Documentation">
	Documentation
  </Select.Option>
  <Select.Option value="Learning"> Learning</Select.Option>
  <Select.Option value="Meeting"> Meeting</Select.Option>
  <Select.Option value="Miscellaneous">
	Miscellaneous
  </Select.Option>
  <Select.Option value="Planning"> Planning</Select.Option>
  <Select.Option value="Refactoring"> Refactoring</Select.Option>
  <Select.Option value="Testing"> Testing</Select.Option>
</Select>
```

> [!NOTE]
> I am also doing this for the `Modal` component when we are **editing** a 'TODO' item!

Speaking and showing my code to one of the developers, he was like "*Why are you doing that*?", "*Why are you hard-coding the values*?". He is telling to basically "*automate*" the process of **adding** more categories.

Currently, if I was to **change** or **add** another *category*... I would first have to update the *migration file* and then make other `<Select.Option> ` tag!

> Now what if we have a million "*category*"?

- Create a shared category list `server/db/config/categories.js` file:

```js
// define the available categories that match the ENUM in the database migration
const TODO_CATEGORIES = [
  "Code Review",
  "Coding",
  "Debugging",
  "Deployment",
  "Documentation",
  "Learning",
  "Meeting",
  "Miscellaneous",
  "Planning",
  "Refactoring",
  "Testing",
];

// export the list
module.exports = {
  TODO_CATEGORIES,
};
```

> Now, whenever we need to **add** / **remove** a *category* we can simply modify the `categories.js` file!

- Update our `server/db/migrations/<DateTime> _create_todos_table.js` file to use the `categories.js` / `TODO_CATEGORIES` file:

```js
// import the 'categories' list
const { TODO_CATEGORIES } = require("../../config/categories");

// creation of 'todos' table
exports.up = function (knex) {
  // use the `createTable` function to define - create table in database
  return knex.schema.createTable("todo", (table) => {
    // our fields
    table.increments("id").primary();
    table.text("description").notNullable();
	
    // use the `TODO_CATEGORIES` instead of the hardcoding each value
    table.enu("category", TODO_CATEGORIES).defaultTo("Miscellaneous");
	
    table.boolean("completed").defaultTo(false);

    // add time stamps of when created / updated
    table.timestamps(true, true);

    // create the field for the foreign key here
    table.integer("user_id").unsigned().notNullable();
    // make the actual link using 'references'
    table.foreign("user_id").references("user.id").onDelete("CASCADE");
  });
};

// other code here
```

- Update the controller file to make achieve 'GET' request to `TODO_CATEGORIES` list:

```js
// import the `TODO_CATEGORIES` list
const { TODO_CATEGORIES } = require("../config/categories");

// other codes here

// function to get available categories
const getCategories = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // return the list of possible categories that match the ENUM in the database
    // this matches the categories defined in the migration file
    const categories = TODO_CATEGORIES;

    res.json({
      message: "Categories retrieved successfully",
      categories,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Get categories error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: "Server error while fetching categories",
    });
  }
};

// UPDATE: export the functions that are going to be create to the 'CRUD' operations of TODOs
module.exports = {
  getTodos,
  createTodo,
  updateTodo,
  deleteTodo,
  getCategories,
};
```

- Update our `server/routers/todoRouters.js` file:

```js
// get available categories ( 'GET method on `/api/todos/categories`' )
router.get("/categories", authenticateToken, todoController.getCategories);
```

- Update the `client/src/services/api.js` file:

```js
// other codes

// get available categories ( endpoint )
export const getCategories = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await api.get("/todos/categories");
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error.response?.data || { error: "Failed to fetch categories" };
  }
};

// other codes
```

> [!NOTE] Again...
> Now, we are going to have to update our `client/src/components/InputDisplayTodos.jsx` file to use the `TODO_CATEGORIES` / `getCategories` in the `Select` component instead of hard coding it.

# Back-end Issue - Migration File

In terms of functionality and implementation there are no issues, but...

> Then where's the actual issue!

I made a single letter typo ( *a typo nonetheless* )! In our `server/db/migrations/<DateTime> _create_todos_table.js` I made this typo when typing 'Refactoring'.

```js
    table
      .enu("category", [
        "Code Review",
        "Coding",
        "Debugging",
        "Deployment",
        "Documentation",
        "Learning",
        "Meeting",
        "Miscellaneous",
        "Planning",
        "Refactorig", // typo issue right here
        "Testing",
      ])
      .defaultTo("Miscellaneous");
```

> Instead I wrote 'Refactorig'!!!

> [!NOTE]
> I corrected the mistake that I made above in the note!

Therefore, to  be able to solve this issue, we are going to have to **revert** back and then make the migrations, meaning that we are going to have to *re-write* the files inside the `server/db/migrations` folder.

But before we actually do anything, let's see some of the other options that we have!

## Start Clean - Revert / Rollback Everything

> [!BUG] Don't Use This Method In Production Environment!!!
> This is *extremely* **dangerous** as its going to wipe the fuck out of everything!
>
> In the real world instead of starting out from scratch, you run the `npx knex migrate:make table_name` whereby its ( *in our case* ) going to create the file(s) inside the `migrations` folder and then after populating it, then we run the `npx knex migrate:latest` which is going to actually write *things* to the database.

Let's say that you are working and you are still on the **pre-testing** phase. Therefore, its okay to use this method as you are **not** going to be affecting anyone.

> Hence, let's do this shit!

- Revert the **all** the migrations:

```bash
# make sure that you are in the 'server' folder

# rollback the migrations
npx knex migrate:rollback --all
```

> [!BUG] Fuck Shit!
> This is the **error** that I got after running the above command:
>
> ```console
> Using environment: development

### No Data In Database

> [!BUG] I **cannot** create / register any users!

As we have deleted the whole database file, this means that we **lost** all of our users and *their* respective 'TODO' items.

Therefore, I started **both** the back-end and front-end server. Now then registering the a new user gives me the error:

> This is the *log* that our back-end is giving us:

```console
Registration error: [Error: select * from `user` where `email` = 'test@email.com' or (`username` = 'test') limit 1 - SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: user] {
  errno: 1,
  code: 'SQLITE_ERROR'
}
```

- Check the status of the migrations using the following command:

```bash
# check the status of the migration
npx knex migrate:status
```

- *In my case*, I get the following output:

```console
Using environment: development
No Completed Migration files Found.
Found 2 Pending Migration file/files.
20251107113745_create_users_table.js
20251107113746_create_todos_table.js
```

"*Pending*"... What the actual fuck, we did absolutely run the `npx knex migrate:latest` command above!

- Running the migration command again:

```bash
# run the migration again
npx knex migrate:latest
```

- The output after running the above command:

```console
Using environment: development
Batch 1 run: 2 migrations
```

- Run the `status` command to check if migrations has been applied

```bash
# check the status of the migration ( again )
npx knex migrate:status
```

- This is the status / output after running the the migration again:

```console
Using environment: development
Found 2 Completed Migration file/files.
20251107113745_create_users_table.js
20251107113746_create_todos_table.js
No Pending Migration files Found.
```

> [!SUCCESS]
> Going into the `app.db` database file using the `sqlite3` command; running the following command:

# Migrating To Neon DB

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://neon.com/
> - https://vercel.com/
> - https://render.com/

Given that I want / will host my React 'TODO' application online. One of the developers was telling me to check our 'Vercel' or 'Render'. Given that I have seen many people online use Vercel, I am going to go with it!

> [!BUG] The Problem
> The main problem is that 'SQLite' is **not** supported by Vercel. Therefore I am going to have to switch to the other supported "*databases*".
>
> Because its not really the actual database, we are talking about '**Managed Database-as-a-Service**' ( 'DBaaS' ) which is basically a *database on "[cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_database)"*.
>

Therefore, speaking with some of the developers here; as they use '[Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)', they recommend to use 'Neon'. Therefore, I am going to switch to it, right now, right here.

## Setup Neon

> [!INFO] Sign Up and Project Creation
> - Project Name: TODO - React Web App
> - Postgresql: 17
> - Cloud Service Provider: AWS
> - Region: AWS Asia Pacific 1 (Singapore)
> - Enable Neon Auth: True

> [!SUCCESS]
> I have been able to **create** our first "*project*" and I have been redirected to this URL `https://console.neon.tech/app/projects/`!

### Setup Connection

Upon being redirected to the above link ( *or simply go to that link* ), you are going to see your first Project, click on it and in the 'Dashboard' tab there is going to be a <button> Connect</button> press it and **save** the connection string.

> This is the main way that our *application* is going to **connect** to the database found on the server!

- This is how the connection string looks like:

```console
psql 'postgresql://neondb_owner:****************@ep-twilight-bonus-a1yrz92a-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require'
```

> I have hidden the password so that you don't see it... *Obviously*!

- Go ahead and **uninstall** `sqlite3` and **install** `pg`:

```bash
# make sure that you are inside the `server/` folder
cd server

# uninstall sqlite3 node package
npm uninstall sqlite3

# install pg node package
npm install pg
```

> You should see that the `server/package.json` file has been updated!

#### Update Our Knex Database Connection File

> [!INFO] Resource(s)
> - https://knexjs.org/guide/#configuration-options

- Therefore go ahead and update our `server/knexfile.js` like so:

```js
// knexfile.js
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  development: {
    client: "postgresql",
    connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    pool: {
      min: 2,
      max: 10,
    },
    migrations: {
      directory: "./db/migrations",
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: "./db/seeds",
    },
  },

  production: {
    client: "postgresql",
    connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    pool: {
      min: 2,
      max: 10,
    },
    migrations: {
      directory: "./db/migrations",
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: "./db/seeds",
    },
  },
};
```

> [!TIP] What is `pool`?
> It refer to the number of *connections* that stays open whereby Knex **reuses** them instead of destroying it and recreating another one!

#### Update Our Environment File

- Add the connection string like so to the `.env` file:

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=api_key_to_be_added_later

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:****************@ep-twilight-bonus-a1yrz92a-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

> [!WARNING] **Not** The Same Connection String
> Yes, you are going to have to modify the connection string so that it looks like this ( when added to `DATABSE_URL` ):
>
> ```console
> postgresql://neondb_owner:****************@ep-twilight-bonus-a1yrz92a-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
> ```

> Obviously this `****************` is my password!

#### Delete The Old SQLite Database Files

- Remove the `server/db/app.db` file from our project:

```bash
# if you are at the root of the `server` folder
rm db/app.db
```

> [!INFO]
> Optionally... Update the `.gitignore` file to **remove** all the "*things*" related to SQLite!

#### Run The Migrations

- Therefore check what *pending* migrations that we still have:

```bash
# check the status of the migration
npx knex migrate:status
```

- This is the output that I get:

```console
[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (4) from .env -- tip: ⚙️  load multiple .env files with { path: ['.env.local', '.env'] }
Using environment: development
No Completed Migration files Found.
Found 2 Pending Migration file/files.
20251107113745_create_users_table.js
20251107113746_create_todos_table.js
```

- Therefore, simply run the following command to migrate:

```bash
# migrate / create of tables over at Neon
npx knex migrate:latest
```

- This is the output after running the above `migrate` command:

```console
[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (4) from .env -- tip: 🔐 prevent building .env in docker: https://dotenvx.com/prebuild
Using environment: development
Batch 1 run: 2 migrations
```

> [!SUCESS]
> > OMG It Fucking Worked!
>
> Running the `migrate:status` 'knex' command; I see that we have **no** pending migrations and also heading over to the 'Tables' tab over at Neon.
>
> I do see that the tables have been created!

## Running The TODO Application

After starting **both** *front-end* and *back-end* local, development servers using the `npm run dev` command, I see that it ran perfectly fine!

As I have just created **new** tables for both `todo` and `user`... I decided to create our little 'test' user. But when **registering**; I got this error:

```console
__AuthPages.jsx:92__ Registration error:
	1. {error: 'Server error during registration'}
		1. error: "Server error during registration"
	   2. [[Prototype]]: Object
  handleRegister@__AuthPages.jsx:92__
```

This is simply due to the fact that there are going to be **differences** in SQLite's syntax compared to 'Postgres'. Therefore we are going to have to update our "*controllers*" so that they now uses the 'Postgres' syntax.

- Head over to the `server/db/controllers/authController.js` file and update line '37' to line '47' ( *register function* ) to this:

```js
    // if user does not exists and all inputs are inserted correctly ==> add the user to database
    const [result] = await db("user")
      .insert({
        username,
        email,
        password: hashedPassword,
      })
      .returning("*");

    // get the 'ID' from the returning result
    const userId = result.id;
```

- Head over to the `server/db/controllers/todoController.js` file and update line '37' to line '47' ( *register function* ) to this:

```js
// for the create todo function

// other codes here
    // insert the new TODO item into the database
    const [newTodo] = await db("todo")
      .insert({
        user_id: userId,
        description,
        category: category || "Miscellaneous",
        completed: false,
      })
      .returning("*");
// other codes here

// for the update todo function
// other codes here
    // get the update and return query in one object
    const [updatedTodo] = await db("todo")
      .where({ id: todoId })
      .update(updateData)
      .returning("*");

// other codes here
```

> [!SUCCESS]
> I see that I have been able to successfully:
>
> - **Register** and **Login** User
> - **Create**, **Update** and **Delete** 'TODO' Item

# Vercel

This is the platform that we are going to use to **host**, **deploy** our 'TODO' application. I have already signed in and we are going to get started with *deploying* our application to the world!

- Create the `server/vercel.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "server.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Update the `server/.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
node_modules/
.env
.vercel
```

> Then push the changes to **remote** repository!

## Deploying On Vercel

### Back-End Deployment

Head over to the link 'https://vercel.com/dashboard' to get started with the **deployment**!

> [!TIP] Steps
> - Click on the 'Add New' button and select the 'Project' option
> - Import the correct GitHub repository ( *like our `first-todo-react` repository* )
> - Root Directory: `server`
> - Framework Preset: Other
> - Build Command: Leave Empty / `npm install`
> - Output Directory: Leave Empty
> - Install Command: `npm install`
> - Click on the 'Deploy' button
>
> > [!NOTE]
> > We are going to be adding the **Environment Variables** later on!
> >
> > > So its totally okay if it does not deploy!
> >
>

> [!TIP] Setting Up Environment Variables
> After the initial deployment above; head over to the 'Settings' tab for our project and click on the 'Environment Variables' option.
>
> Therefore, add the "*required*" variables ( *again, found inside the `server/.env` file* ) and **click** 'Save' after *adding* **each** one!
>
> > [!NOTE]
> > In my `.env` file, I have this:
> >
> > ```env
> > JWT_SECRET=api_key_to_be_added_later
> > ```
> >
> > Therefore, I am going to simply **omit** it!
>
> After adding "*everything*", simply click on the 'Redeploy' button that appears in the bottom right corner of head over to the 'Deployment' tab above and redeploy!

> [!SUCCESS]
> Therefore, in my case, I get the following link, 'https://first-todo-react-one.vercel.app/', whereby its going to output the *response* like so:
>
> ```console
> {
>  "message": "TODO API Running!",
>  "status": "success"
> }
> ```

### Run Migrations On Production / Vercel

```bash
# switch `NODE_ENV` to `production` temporarily
export NODE_ENV=production

# run the migrations
npx knex migrate:latest

# verify the migration
npx knex migrate:status
```

- This is the output that I get after running the above commands:

```console
[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (3) from .env -- tip: ⚙️  enable debug logging with { debug: true }
Using environment: production
Already up to date
[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (3) from .env -- tip: 🛠️  run anywhere with `dotenvx run -- yourcommand`
Using environment: production
Found 2 Completed Migration file/files.
20251107113745_create_users_table.js
20251107113746_create_todos_table.js
No Pending Migration files Found.
```

### Front-End Deployment

Now that we have deployed our back-end; we need to also deploy the **front-end** so that the user will be able to interact with it!

- Update the `client/src/services/api.js` file:

```js
// update only the `API_BASE_URL` variable

// our base URL for the back-end ( API ) --> "vercel" backend + localhost
const API_BASE_URL =
  import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || "http://localhost:5000/api";
```

- Create a `.env.development` file for the **front-end**:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

- Create a `.env.production` file for the **front-end**:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.vercel.app/api
```

- Update our `.gitignore` file to **not** push these `.env`s file:

```gitignore
.env
.env.local
.env.production
.vercel
```

> Therefore push the changes to the **remote** repository!

Head over to the link 'https://vercel.com/dashboard' to get started with the **deployment**!

> [!TIP] Steps
> - Click on the 'Add New' button and select the 'Project' option
> - Import the correct GitHub repository ( *like our `first-todo-react` repository* )
> - Root Directory: `client`
> - Framework Preset: Vite
> - Build Command: `npm run build`
> - Output Directory: `dist`
> - Install Command: `npm install`
> - Click on the 'Deploy' button
> - Add the required Environment Variables

> [!SUCCESS]
> I have now been able to deploy my web-app on Vercel and anyone can access it!

## Update Vercel Back-End's Environment Variables

As the heading suggests, we need to update the back-end's environment variables to *reflect* the 'production' "*environment*"!

> Make sure to use `production` for `NODE_ENV` and also the **production** connection string for `DATABASE_URL`!

- Update our `server/server.js` file:

```js
// other codes here
	
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: [
      "http://localhost:5173",
      "https://first-todo-react-dstv.vercel.app/",
    ],
    credentials: true,
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
  }),
);

// other codes here
```

## Generate JSON Web Token Secret Key

- Use the following command to generate a strong 'JWT' key:

```bash
# generate the 'JWT' token "key" with 'node'
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

- Generate something that looks like this:

```console
a3f5d8e9c2b1a4f7e6d3c8b9a2f5e1d4c7b3a9f6e2d8c1b5a7f4e3d9c6b2a8f5
```

> Therefore add the `JWT_SECRET` key-value pair to the back-end's environment variables!

> [!SUCCESS]
> Fuck!!! It was the `JWT_SECRET` key!
>
> But I can not successfully use the web-app!

# Delete Account

We do want to give the user the ability to **delete** his / her account... Therefore, we are going to have to update *things* from the database to be able to get the functionality that we want in our front-end.

> Hence!

- Update our `server/controllers/userController.js` file with the following function:

```js
// asynchronous function that will be used to delete user profile entirely
const deleteAccount = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // get the crendentials from the 'JSON' body
    const userId = req.user.userId;

    // check if the user already exists
    const existingUser = await db("user").where({ id: userId }).first();

    if (!existingUser) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: "Username or email does not exists",
      });
    }

    // delete the user from the database
    await db("user").where({ id: userId }).del();

    res.json({
      message: "User profile successfully deleted",
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Deletion error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: "Server error during deletion",
    });
  }
};

// export the function to be used by others
module.exports = {
  getUserProfile,
  
  // NOTE: don't forget to export the 'deleteAccount' functioon
  deleteAccount,
};
```

- Update the `server/routers/userRouters.js` file:

```js
// delete the user from the database
router.delete("/", authenticateToken, userController.deleteAccount);
```

- Update the `client/services/api.js` file:

```js
// delete an existing user ( endpoint )
export const deleteUser = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await api.delete("/user");
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error.response?.data || { error: "Deletion of account failed" };
  }
};
```

- Update the `client/components/ProfileMenu.jsx` file:

```jsx
// other codes here

// import the required components from 'antd'
import { Button, Modal } from "antd";

// other codes here

  // function to be able to delete the user's account
  const handleDelete = async () => {
    try {
      // call the function to be able to delete the user account
      await deleteUser();

      // log the user out
      logout();

      // go back to the login - register page
      navigate("/");
    } catch (error) {
      // log the error to the console
      console.error(`Failed to delete account`, error);
    }
  };

// other codes here

            <li>
              <Button
                onClick={() => {
                  setShowDeleteModal(true);
                  setOpen(false);
                }}
                type="text"
                danger
              >
                Delete Account
              </Button>
            </li>

// other codes here

      <Modal
        title="Confirm Account Deletion"
        open={showDeleteModal}
        onOk={handleDelete}
        onCancel={() => setShowDeleteModal(false)}
        okText="Yes, Delete"
        cancelText="No, Cancel"
        okButtonProps={{ danger: true }}
      >
        <p>
          Are you sure you want to delete your account? This action cannot be
          undone and all your data will be permanently removed.
        </p>
      </Modal>

// other codes here
```

> [!SUCCESS]
> We have now been able to implement the 'Delete Account' button / functionality to our web-app!
